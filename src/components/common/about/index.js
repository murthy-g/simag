        <b>OUR STORY</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The idea was born in 1991, during an age when computers were booming in
        the market. Our chief, Mr. Saifuddin, who was an iron and steel merchant
        then, decided that the need of the hour was to bring these computers to
        homes, to personal offices, and hence started with manufacturing
        computer tables under the brand named 'Kreators'. The age kept changing,
        but our values still remain intact, our products were revolutionalized
        as the time passed, but our commitment still remains a constant. Today,
        he believes that emotions and technology should go hand in hand, and the
        evolution of office furniture will keep happening at Kreators. We make
        the best efforts to put your thought process into reality, design what
        you desire and establish a connection over timber.
